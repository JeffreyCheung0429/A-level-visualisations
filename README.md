These are some projects that I have done during my A-levels. Most of them are visualisations that help with understanding on a few topics in the A-level computer science syllabus. All of them are written in Python using the built-in tkinter library, so you do not have to install any extra library to be able to see it. There are some few bugs here and there that may raise an error in the console but the main program should be functioning to match the purpose to demonstrate concepts. I currently not planning to fix the bugs but if there's an interest on that, just raise an issue and let me know.

Thanks and have fun!
